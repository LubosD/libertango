# FDM Printing Advice

# Flat design

The flat design is a little easier to print. Print the models upside down and enable supports, which will be used for a few small details.

# Round design

The round design is harder to print, but the final look is a little more appealing than the flat one.

* Print the design upright, supports are not needed (bridging will be used).
* Use an adaptive layer height of 0.2-0.05mm.
* Infill should be at least 30%, lest the top surface's quality will likely suffer.
