# Libertango
This is a collection of wall faceplates and frames for 3D printing. The design is intended to be mutually compatible (but not identical) with [ABB Tango](http://www117.abb.com/index.asp?thema=2709).

For now, it consists of Ethernet faceplates (double and single), audio faceplates and frames for one or more faceplates.

Designed using [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org).
